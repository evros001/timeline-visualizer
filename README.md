## Background

Cool Story, Bro is a Ruby/Rails and Javascript application that makes use of the Google Maps API. It was made at the Flatiron School by students Adam Czerepinski, Stefania Sicurelli, and Evan Rosse.

## Usage

Users can explore maps that are populated with stories by other users. The stories appear as icons on the map, and contain the location(s) and description of what happened in the story. Users can create an account to save and share their own stories.

## Development/Contribution

This is a student portfolio project, so the original authors will be the only ones making updates for the time being. However, we welcome feedback! See contact info below.

## Future

Add the option for users to upload an image to their story or to each location of the story.
